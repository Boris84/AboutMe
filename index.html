  <p>Hi all, i am Simon. In May 2005 i was diagnosed with a life changing crohnic illness called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease"style="color: blue">Crohn's Disease</a>. I have spent the past 13 years in and out of hospital having multiple surgeries. Before i was diagnosed, i was working towards a carpentry degree with a provider called John Laing (who are no longer around now). While i was in hospital, i met 3 other guys who were in their early 20's at the time and in the same situation as me. One has gone awol and the other two unfortunately will never get better (according to the surgeons), so i consider myself extremely fortunate and grateful for a second chance.<br/> 
  <br/>
  During this period, i had to think really hard about what i would like to do considering the Dr's and Surgeons told me i would still have a good quality of life. I seached around to get back into carpentry, i had no joy, i considered working in the hospital too because i know so much about that now.<br/>
  <br/> 
  One day during lunchtime in hospital, i bumped into a woman in the corridor, she reconised what i had on me at the time was the same thing her son had on him, so she knew we had similar issues. She said hello and started talking to me asking about my illness, i was only to happy to talk to her (as you probably know hospitals can be a lonely place). She asked if i would like to come and meet her son (Ryan) as he has the same condition as me and he wasn't doing very well with coping as he was recently diagnosed. Little did i know that this would be the start for me! I was only too happy to go and meet him as at the time i was in there alone.<br/>
  <br/>
  So we enter into a side room , and i looked to my right and on the bed i saw a fraile figure of a young man in his early - mid twenties curled up on the bed, he looked so frightend of the unknown. His mum introduced me, he quickly perked up when he realised he had a visitor. I found out later that day that Ryan was a software developer, he studied and got his bsHons at a university in Lancashire and was a fully fleged software developer, he was also a police officer. We started hanging out and he showed me some of the app he made himself (kids games) that were now in the playStore selling at Â£0.99. I was fascinated , and he said to me that i could do the same thing , nowadays you no longer have to go to university and do a 4 year course to become a software dev he said you can do it all online now as long as you have the time and the determination.<br/> 
  <br/>
  He did much better over the following weeks / months and was realeased from hospital. He had his final surgery and went back to work doing what he loves, with only a small scar down the middle of his belly as a reminder of his experience. So when i finally got discharged, i was a home one day on my pc and i came across this website called CodeCademy and the rest as they say is history. I earnt a credential "build websites from scratch" from codecademy because i finished all of the coursework ontime and submitted my final project "capstone" which the tutors were collectively impressed with.<a href="https://www.credential.net/go9gf2ie"style="color: blue"/>My Credentials.</a></p>
