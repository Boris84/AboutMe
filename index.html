    <section class="a"> 
      <p>My name is Simon. In may 2005 at the North Middlesex University Hospital in north London, i was diagnosed with a life changing chronic illness called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">"Crohn's Disease" </a>which is a type of (IBD) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease" target="_blank">"Inflammatory Bowel Disease"</a>. Some of you may have heard about this or the names "Crohn's & Colitis". Well , Ulcerative Colitis is a sibling of crohn's but there is one distinct contrast in that crohn's can affect any part of the bodies (GI) Gastro Intestinal Tract, where as Ulcerative Colitis only affects the Colon (large bowel). I have spent the past 13 years in and out of the (RLH) Royal London Hospital undergoing multiple re-attempts at corrective surgery. Before i was diagnosed, i was working towards a carpentry degree with a provider called John Laing. The Royal London Hospital has been re-built over the past 10 years. I have been fortunate enough to experience the best of both worlds "so to speak". The old and the newly build Royal London Hospital equipt with it's leading trauma and emergency care centres and home to London's Air Ambulance service. </p>

      <p>In August 2009 , i was transferred to the Royal London in Whitechapel for my second operation because NMH did not have gastro specialist surgeon's at that time to perform my operation. The Dr's and Surgeons told me i would still have a good quality of life. While i was in hospital, i met 3 other guys who were in their early - mid 20's at the time and in the same situation as me. The first (David) had crohnic progressive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis" target="_blank">"Ulcerative Colitis"</a> and was in constanly pain , the other two (Ash and Abdul) had crohn's like me but unfortunately Ash is no longer around and Abdul will never get better (according to the surgeons) , so i consider myself extremely fortunate and grateful for a second shot at life. Things may not have turned out a so well for me , if i ignored my instincts at the time. I also met an extremely clever , talented , warm , caring , beautiful individual (inside and out) who helped me so much during my time in hospital for which i am forever grateful. We are still friends to this day. That's is to say good things can come from bad situations.<p/>

      <p>One day during lunchtime in hospital , i bumped into a woman in the corridor , she recognised that the intravenous medication i was administering at the time was similar to the medication her son was currently on , so i guess she kind of figured we had similar issues. She introduced herself and started asking questions about my illness. She asked if i would like to come and meet her son (Ryan) as he has the same condition , and he wasn't doing that great with coping as he recently had his first surgery. I was only too happy to go and meet him , as at the time i was in hospital alone. So after lunch , i went to his room and knocked on the door. They invited me in , and on the bed to my right i saw young man (early - mid twenties) curled up on the bed , he looked fragile and frightened. His mum introduced me , he quickly perked up. We started talking about Crohn's , surgery and nutrition. I found out later that Ryan currently had 2 jobs , he studied for a 4 years and got his BSc(Hons)(Bachelor of Science) at a university in Lancashire and was working as a software engineer/developer , he was also a police officer. We became friends and he showed me some of the apps that he made (kid games) that were now in the playStore selling at £0.99. I was fascinated , impressed and amazed , he said that nowadays you no longer have to go to university and do a 4 year course to become a software developer , everything can be done online now as long as you have the time and the drive to do it.<p/><br/>

      <p>Ryan made a full recovery and was discharged within the few weeks. I finally got discharged a few weeks after. I was at home one day on my pc and i came across a coding course provider called CodeCademy. I read all about what they provide , what i should get out of the course and everything else before signing up. Everything seemed okay and i had the time so i paid and enrolled. Within a year i earnt the credential "Build Websites From Scratch" from the Codecademy Pro Intensive curriculum. The tutors were collectively impressed with my final "Capstone" project.

Github Inc is a web-based hosting service for (VC) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">"Version Control"</a> using a terminal/tool called Git. It is mostly used for computer code. Github offers all the distributed "version control" and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding it's own features. (Metaphorically speaking) It's a child element of the Microsoft Corperation (which is the parent). It's headquaters are based in San Fransico , but have offices in Amsterdam , Netherlands , Boulder , CO , Tokyo , Japan and also has co-working  spaces acroos the major cites in the US and Globally. Github logged its first "commit" way back in 2007 and has hosted more than 100 million repositories. At present , Github has more than 31 million registered users across the globe who currently who use github to build software. Github was founded in 2008 by Chris Wandstrath , PJ Hyett , Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon. Github currently has over 800 employees , of which 65 are "remote". Github is trusted by 1.8m businesses and organisations. Github also has it's own "text-editor" called Atom which is "open-sourced" since May 2014 and built on "Electron". Electron was initially developed for the Atom "text-editor". Electron is Github's "open-source framework" for creating native applications with web-tech's like JavaScript , HTML and CSS. Every time i create a website , i use Github and Github "pages" to manage and store version's of my work. I have been using Github now for almost 2 years. I first was taught the in's and out's of Github by CodeCademy tutors.

    <p>I am extremely fortunate and grateful to have support advice and guidance from non profit charities that work closely with IBD type conditions , namely <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/" target="_blank">Crohn's and Colitis UK</a> and the aftercare and homecare companies who help patients manage thier lives to make it that bit easier to cope with. In June 2017 my friend and i took part in a fundraising event called "Walk it". I managed to raise over £250 from sponsors and during the walk we did our bit to raise awareness by educating a few members of the public. Crohn's and Colitis's primary objective is to raise awareness for the condition. Every year Crohn's and Colitis Uk hold <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/get-involved/fundraising" target="_blank">"fundraising events"</a> such as walks , runs , cycling , treks , skydiving , swimming and bungee jumping for charity to bring people together with similar conditions and help fund research and development to provide specialist support and advise for people suffering with IBD. There are also quite a lot of "Celebrities" who also take part in raising money for the condition , some of whom have Crohn's or Colitis themselves. Celebrities include: Rylan Clark Neil (co-host of the tv series Big Brother) and Sam Faiers who was at the walk i attended in June 2017 , Anastasia (the singer) , Lewis Moody , Sir Steve Redgrave (five-time olympic gold medal champion) and Jeff Hordley (who plays Cain Dingle in the ITV british soap opera Emmerdale). Here is a video of Jeff sharing his experiences and when he was first diagnosed. Jeff became an ambassador for IBD in 2009. He is extremely passionate about supporting and raising awareness for C&C UK.

  <section class="d"> 
    <p>At present there is no diagnosis to pin-point the actual cause of Crohn's or Colitis and there is also no cure. This is why supporting C&CUk is extremely important , because with funding C&CUk can do more research and conduct trails amoungst many other things. For more than 30 years Crohn's and Colitis have been leading the drive to increase knowledge and the best treatments of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis patients. C&C Uk have recently published a book called "The Power Of Research - 10 Years of Crohn's and Colitis Uk research" and £5.2 million has been awarded to over 80 research projects since 2008. The research conducted by medical professionals leads to vital discoveries about the different forms of IBD - and continuies to do so. The studies C&CUK fund help medical professionals develop better treatments and support for IBD patients. If you know somebody who has IBD , perhaps a family member of friend or you would want to give support , head on over to the <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/" target="_blank">Crohn's and Colitis UK</a> official website and click the green button to sign up to "become a member"! Its completely free of charge! Or if you just want to make a donation , go ahead and hit the pink "Donate" button on the main page. Crohn's & Colitis UK need your support.

    <p>I left CodeCademy after a year and a half and i found another course provider (online) called <a href="https://foundersandcoders.com/" target="_blank">"Founder & Coders"</a>. Founders & Coders are a UK based non-profit organisation (unlike CodeCademy) that run a tuition-free academy in London. They are essentially a bootcamp , and they have many offices but only two that im familiar with at present, an office in North London (finsbury park) and an office in Israel (Nazereth). Over the past 2 years more than 90% of F&C graduates have gone onto work in software or a related field. F&C generate income by charging recrutment fees when employers hire F&C graduates. F&C also provide technical support and training to other non-profits , local businesses and start-ups. If you are looking to get onto any of the F&C cohort programmes , you will need to first get through the entry stage which is a set of enrty pre-requesites to show F&C that you at least know the basics of web development. The first set of pre-req's are to work through (Fcc) FreeCodeCamp's introductory exercises , which are all the basics of web development eg: Responsive Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. The next set of pre-req's is to reach 5kyu (300 honour points) by completing "Kata's" on <a href ="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">"Codewars"</a> (Kata's are code puzzles). CodeWars provides a great introduction to the art of "problem-solving" which is what a web developer's role is all about. Then you are given the option to either create your own Kata or a image carousel. Lastly , you would need to create a one-page website. The main thing i like about F&C - unlike many other organisations , is that they are non-profit. Click on the following link to see my completed <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/" id="camp" target="_blank" style="color: red;">Fcc Pre-Requesites</a> for Founder's & Coders.</p>

      <h2 id="mycarsl">My Carousel</h2>

  <section>
    <p>The second to last prerequesite for the Founders & Coders entry requirements, is a choice of two options. Option 1 is to (as mentioned previously) is to create your own Kata(exercise). Option 2 is to create your own image slider otherwise reffered to as an image Carousel. I decided to go for "option 2" as i have absolutely no practice at creating kata's. So i have crated an image carousel containing three images. The user can "scroll" through the images using the "previous" and "next" pointers on the left and right side of the carousel. I have also added a "counter" (top left) that counts from 1 - 3. Every time the user clicks the "next" pointer (on the right of the carousel) the image will change/slide to the next image and the "counter" with switch its count to "2" , once the user reaches the 3rd image , and then clicks "next" again , the whole process will be repeated. As it's the same process for the "previous" pointer of the left side of the carousel only the "counter" will count backwards. I used HTML , CSS and JavaScript to build the carousel. Html is used for typography/text and the overall basis/ foundation on which to build the carousel. Css is used for the style eg: colors , positioning, borders etc. JavaScript is the is used for the functionality of the carousel. I also build the image carousel using Responsive Web design (which was also a requirement). Responsive design is an approch to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Responsive Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide , shrink , or enlarge , a website , to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). I created my carousel in an online text editor called<a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank"> "CodePen"</a>. CodePen is an online community for testing , and showcasing user-created HTML , CSS and JavaScript code snippets. It functions as an online code editor and open source learning enviroment where developers can create code snippets, creatively named "pens", and test them. Click on the following link to veiw <a href="" id="cpcrsl" target="_blank" style="color: red;">My Carousel</a> in the CodePen text editor.
