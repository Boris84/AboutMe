        <h2 id="myStory">My Story</h2>

    <section class="a"> 
      <p>My name is Simon. Around early 2000 i started to feel unwell. The symptoms i was had at the time were vomiting, sweating, stomatch and back pain, loss of appitite and weight loss. I would get anxious and used to dred meal-times as i knew i couldn't hold anything down. I got little rest due to the stomatch and back pain. This went on for many years and i was attending hospital and having tratement but the the doctor who's care i was under could not pin-point a diagnosis. In 2005 at the North Middlesex University Hospital in north London, i underwent my first major surgical procedure. The next 4 years for me were a living hell. I literally went about my day to day life with a hole in my abdomen, which was discharging. In August 2009, i was transferred to the Royal London Hospital for my second operation because NMH didn't have any gastro specialist surgeon's at that time to perform my operation. I was diagnosed with a life changing chronic illness called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">"Crohn's Disease"</a> which is a type of (IBD)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease" target="_blank">"Inflammatory Bowel Disease"</a>. My surgeon expressed to me how fortunate i was to still have a good quality of life. You may have heard of "IBD" or the names "Crohn's & Colitis". Well, Colitis aka "Ulcerative Colitis" is actually a sibling of Crohn's but there is one distinct contrast in that Crohn's can affect any part of the bodies (GI) Gastro Intestinal Tract, where as Colitis only affects the Colon (large bowel). I have spent the past 15 years in and out of the (RLH) "Royal London Hospital" in Whitechapel east London undergoing multiple re-attempts at corrective surgery.</p>

    <section>
      <p> Before i was diagnosed, i was working towards a carpentry degree with a provider called John Laing. The Royal London has been re-built over the past 10 years. I have been fortunate to experience the best of both worlds "so to speak". The old and the newly build Royal London Hospital equipt with it's leading trauma and emergency care centres and home to London's Air Ambulance service. While i was in hospital, i met three lads in their early - mid 20's at the time and in the same situation as me. The first (David) had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis" target="_blank"> "Ulcerative Colitis"</a> and was in constant pain, the other two (Ash and Abdul) had Crohn's like me but unfortunately one is no longer around and the other will never get better (according to the surgeons) so i consider myself extremely fortunate and grateful. Things may not have turned out so well for me, if i had ignored my instincts at the time. If there is one thing i have learnt through all of this, it is to trust your "gut" instincts.<p/>

      <p>One day during lunchtime in hospital, i bumped into a woman in the corridor, she recognised that the medication i was administering at the time was similar to the medication her son was currently on, so i guess she kind of figured we had similar issues. She introduced herself and started asking questions about my illness. She asked if i would like to come and meet her son "Ryan" (as he has the same condition) and he wasn't doing that great with coping as he recently had his first surgery. I was only too happy to go and meet him, as at the time i was in hospital alone. So after lunch, i went to his room and knocked on the door. They invited me in, and on the bed to my right i saw young man (early - mid twenties) curled up on the bed, he looked extremely fragile and frightened. His mum introduced me, he gradually perked up. We started talking about Crohn's, surgery and nutrition. I found out later that Ryan currently had 2 jobs, he studied for 4 years at a university in Lancashire and got his BSc(Hons) "Bachelor of Science" and was working as a software engineer / developer, he was also a police officer in the Lancashire Constabulary. We became good friends and he showed me some of the apps that he made that were now in the playStore selling at £0.99. I was astonished and fascinated, he said that nowadays you no longer have to go to university and do a 4 year course to become a software developer, everything can be done online now as long as you have the time and the drive to do it.<p/><br/>

      <p>Ryan made a full recovery and was discharged within the few weeks. I finally got discharged a few weeks after Ryan left. Fortunately for me, my condition over the years has gradually got better and i have made a full recovery. One day, at home on my pc and i came across a coding course provider called <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">"CodeCademy"</a> based in the US. I read all about what they provide, what i should get out of the course and everything else before signing up. Everything seemed okay and i had the time so i paid and enrolled. Within a year i earnt the credential "Build Websites From Scratch" from the Codecademy Pro Intensive curriculum. The tutors were collectively impressed with my final <a href="https://github.com/Boris84/Capstone-Colmar-Project" target="_blank">"Capstone"</a> project. (I must mention that it's not displaying how i left it. Everything was lined up, all images were being displayed and the video played). I don't know what's happened but given a bit of time, i could figure it out.

  <section>
      <p>I am extremely fortunate and grateful to have support advice and guidance from non profit charities that work closely with IBD type conditions, namely <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/" target="_blank">Crohn's and Colitis Uk</a> and the aftercare teams and homecare companies who help patients manage thier lives to make it a bit easier to cope with. In June 2017 my friend and i took part in a fundraising event called "Walk it". I managed to raise over £250 from sponsors and during the walk we did our bit to raise awareness by educating a few members of the public. Crohn's and Colitis Uk's primary objective is to raise awareness for the condition. Every year C&CUk hold <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/get-involved/fundraising" target="_blank">"fundraising events"</a> such as walks, runs, cycling, treks, skydiving, swimming and bungee jumping for charity to bring people together with similar conditions and help fund research and development to provide specialist support and advise for people suffering with IBD. There are also quite a lot of "Celebrities" who also take part in raising money for the condition, some of whom have Crohn's or Colitis themselves. Celebrities include: Rylan Clark Neil (co-host of the tv series Big Brother) and Sam Faiers who was at the walk i attended in June 2017, Anastasia (the singer), Lewis Moody, Sir Steve Redgrave (five-time olympic gold medal champion) and Jeff Hordley (who plays Cain Dingle in the ITV british soap opera Emmerdale). Below is a video of Jeff sharing his experiences and when he was first diagnosed. Jeff became an ambassador for IBD in 2009. He is extremely passionate about supporting and raising awareness for C&CUk.

  <section class="d"> 
      <p>At present there is no diagnosis to pin-point the actual cause of Crohn's or Colitis and there is also no cure. This is why supporting C&CUk is extremely important, because with funding C&CUk can do more research and conduct trails amoungst many other things. For more than 30 years Crohn's and Colitis Uk have been leading the drive to increase knowledge and the best treatments of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis patients. C&CUk have recently published a book called "The Power Of Research - 10 Years of Crohn's and Colitis Uk research" and £5.2 million has been awarded to over 80 research projects since 2008. The research conducted by medical professionals leads to vital discoveries about the different forms of IBD - and continuies to do so. The studies C&CUk fund help medical professionals develop better treatments and support for IBD patients. If you know somebody who has IBD, perhaps a family member of friend or maybe you just want to give support, head over to the <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/" target="_blank">Crohn's and Colitis Uk </a>official website, and click the green button to sign up and "Join us". It's completely free of charge. Or if you just want to make a donation, hit the pink "Give now" button on the main page. Crohn's & Colitis Uk need</p></section><section class="e"><p>your support.
      Crohn's affects the gut and then goes onto affect every part of the body. Both of these dibilitating illnesses
      are widely misunderstood. An individual with Crohn's or Colitis can appear completeley normal looking, on the outside, which is why these condition are reffered to as "Invisible Ilnesses". Everyday Crohn's and Colitis has a desvastating impact on the lives of more than 300,000 people across the Uk. The gut is like your body's second brain, so when it goes wrong it can affect every aspect of your life from hormones and digestion to your energy levels and mental health. Stigma and misunderstanding around the conditions, means thousands are suffering in silence. It takes guts to talk about Crohn’s and Colitis - stand with us and everyone affected by these devastating conditions. Come along to <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/get-involved/campaigning" target="_blank">Crohn's and Colitis Awareness Week</a> and Get Involved!</p>

      <h2 id="github">Github</h2>
 
  <section class="c">
      <p>Github is a developer company and the world's leaving software development platform. Github Inc is a web-based hosting service for (VC) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank">"Version Control"</a> using a terminal/tool called Git. It is mostly used for computer code. Github offers all the distributed "version control" and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding it's own features. (Metaphorically speaking) It's a child element of the Microsoft Corperation (which is the parent). It's headquaters are based in San Fransico. Github Inc also have offices in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Boulder, CO, Tokyo, Japan and also has co-working spaces acroos the major cites in the US and Globally. Github logged its first "commit" way back in 2007 and has hosted more than 100 million repositories. At present, Github has more than 31 million registered users across the globe who currently who use github to build software. Github was founded in 2008 by Chris Wandstrath, PJ Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon. Github currently has over 800 employees, of which 65 are "remote". Github is trusted by 1.8m businesses and organisations. Github also has it's own "text-editor" called Atom which is "open-sourced" since May 2014 and built on "Electron". Electron was initially developed for the Atom "text-editor". Electron is Github's "open-source framework" for creating native applications with web-tech's like JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Every time i create a website, i use Github and Github "pages" to manage and store version's of my work. I have been using Github now for almost 2 years. I first was taught the in's and out's of Github by CodeCademy tutors.

  <section class="f">
      <p>I left CodeCademy after a year and a half and i found another course provider online called <a href="https://foundersandcoders.com/" target="_blank">"Founder and Coders"</a>. Founders and Coders are a Uk based non-profit organisation (unlike CodeCademy) that run a tuition-free academy in London. They are essentially a bootcamp, and they have many offices but only two that im familiar with at present, an office in North London (finsbury park) and an office in Israel (Nazereth). Over the past 2 years more than 90% of F&C graduates have gone onto work in software or a related field. F&C generate income by charging recrutment fees when employers hire F&C graduates. F&C also provide technical support and training to other non-profits, local businesses and start-ups. I am applying for the March 2019 cohort at Founders and Coders because i like that they are non-profit, that says alot, and i also love coding and helping others. If you are looking to apply for any of the F&C cohort programmes, you will need to first get through the entry stage which is a set of pre-requesites to show F&C that you at least know the basics of web development. The first set of pre-req's are to work through (fCC) freeCodeCamp's introductory exercises, which are all the basics of web development eg: Responsive Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. The next set of pre-req's is to reach <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/Boris84/badges/large" id="camp" target="_blank">5kyu (300 honour points)</a> by completing "Kata's" on <a href ="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">"CodeWars"</a> (Kata's are code puzzles). CodeWars provides a great introduction to the art of "problem-solving" which is what a web developer's role is all about. Then you are given the option to either create your own "Kata" or a "Image Carousel". Lastly, you would need to create a one-page website. Click on the following 2 links to see my completed <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/boris84" id="camp" target="_blank">fCC</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/Boris84" id="wars" target="_blank">CodeWars</a> pre-req's for Founder's and Coders.</a></p>

      <h2 id="mycarsl">My Carousel</h2>

  <section class="g">
      <p>The second to last prerequesite for the Founders and Coders entry requirements, is a choice of two options (as mentioned previously). "Option 1" is to  is to create your own Kata (exercise). "Option 2" is to create your own image slider otherwise reffered to as an "Image Carousel". I decided to go for "Option 2" as i have absolutely no practice at creating kata's. So i have created an image carousel containing three images. The user can "scroll" forward through the images "left - right" by either clicking the button on the bottom-left of the carousel or by using the "next" pointer - on the right side of the carousel. I have also added a "counter" (top left) that counts from 1 - 3. Every time the user clicks on the "next" pointer, the carousel will scroll / slide to the "next" image and the "counter" will switch its count from "1" to "2", once the user reaches the 3rd image, and then clicks "next" again, the whole process will be repeated, and the same principle is applied for the "prev" pointer - on the left side of the carousel, only the carousel will scroll  / slide to the "previous" image "right - left" and the "counter" will count backwards. The "button" when clicked, will only cause the carousel to scroll forwards - "next" - automatically, until the user clicks the button again which will then "pause" the slide / images and the same process will be repeated when the user clicks the button again. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the carousel. Html is used for typography/text and the overall basis / foundation on which to build the carousel. Css is used for the style eg: colors, positioning, borders etc. JavaScript is the is used for the interactivity and functionality of the carousel. I also built the image carousel using Responsive Web design (which was also a requirement). Responsive design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Responsive Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). Another useful coding tool is an online text editor called<a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank"> "CodePen"</a>. CodePen is an online community for testing, and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets. It functions as an online code editor and open source learning enviroment where developers can create code snippets, creatively named "pens", and test them. We were given the option of either using "CodePen" or "Github" to create our Carousel's on. I chose Github to store versions of my code as that's my preferred platform.
