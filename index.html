    <section class="a"> 
      <p>My name is Simon. In May 2005 at the North Middlesex University Hospital in North London, i was diagnosed with a life changing crohnic illness called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease">"Crohn's Disease"</a> which is a type of (IBD) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</a>. Some of you may have heard about this or the names "Crohn's & Colitis". Well, Ulcerative Colitis is a sibling of Crohn's but there is one distinct contrast in that Crohn's can affect any part of the bodies (GI) Gastro Intestinal Tract, where as Ulcerative Colitis only affects the Colon (large bowel). I have spent the past 13 years in and out of the (RLH) Royal London Hospital undergoing multiple re-attempts at corrective surgery. Before i was diagnosed, i was working towards a carpentry degree with a provider called John Laing. The Royal London Hospital has been re-built over the past 10 years. I have been fortunate enough to experience "the best of both worlds" so to speak. The old and the newly build Royal London Hospital equipt with it's leading trauma and emergency care centres and home to London's Air Ambulance service. </p>

      <p>During this period, i had to think really hard about what i would like to do considering the Dr's and Surgeons told me i would still have a good quality of life. I seached around to get back into carpentry, i had no joy, i also considered working in the hospital because at the time i knew everything in regards to hospital procedure. While i was in hospital, i met 3 other guys who were in their early - mid 20's at the time and in the same situation as me. One has disappeared and the other two unfortunately will never get better (according to the surgeons), so i consider myself extremely fortunate and grateful for a second shot at life. Things may not have turned out a so well for me, if i ignored my instincts at the time. I also met an extremely clever, talented, 
      warm, loving, beautiful individual (inside and out) who helped me so much during my time in hospital. There are simply no words to use to express my feelings towards her. Alas, she had to leave and it literally broke my heart.<p/>

      <p>One day during lunchtime in hospital, i bumped into a woman in the corridor, she recognised that the intravenous medication i was administering at time was similar to the medication her son was currently on, so i guess she kind of figured we had similar issues. She introduced herself and started asking questions about my illness. She asked if i would like to come and meet her son (Ryan) as he has the same condition, and he wasn't doing that great with coping as he recently had his first surgery. I was happy to go and meet him, as at the time i was in hospital alone. So after lunch, i went to his room and knocked on the door. They invited me in, and on the bed to my right i saw young man in his early - mid twenties curled up on the bed, he looked fragile and frightened. His mum introduced me, he quickly perked up. We started talking about Crohn's, surgery and nurtition. I found out later that Ryan currently had 2 jobs, he studied for a 4 years and got his BsHons at a university in Lancashire and was working as a software developer, he was also a police officer. We made friends and he showed me some of the apps that he made (games) that were now in the playStore selling at £0.99. I was fascinated and impressed, and he said that nowadays you no longer have to go to university and do a 4 year course to become a software dev they have everything online now as long as you have the time and the drive to do it.<p/><br/>

      <p>Ryan made a full recovery and was discharged within the few weeks. I finally got discharged and was at home one day on my pc and i came across a course provider called CodeCademy. I paid, enrolled and within a year I earnt a credential "Build Websites From Scratch" from the Codecademy Pro Intensive curriculum. The tutors were collectively impressed with my final "Capstone" project. Here are <a href="https://www.credential.net/go9gf2ie">my credentials</a>.</p>

    <p>I am extremely fortunate and grateful to have support advice and guidance from non profit charities that work closely with IBD type conditions, namely <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/">Crohn's and Colitis UK</a> and the aftercare and homecare companies who help patients manage thier lives to make it that bit easier to cope with. Every year Crohn's and Colitis Uk hold <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/get-involved/fundraising">fundraising events</a> such as walks, runs, cycling, treks, skydiving, swimming and bungee jumping for charity to bring people together with similar conditions and help fund research and development to provide specialist support and advise for people suffering with IBD. In June 2017 my friend and i took part in a fundraising event called "Walk it". I managed to raise over £250 from sponsors and during the walk we did our bit to raise awareness by educating a few members of the public. Crohn's and Colitis's primary objective is to raise awareness for the condition. There are also quite a lot of "Celebrities" who also take part in raising money for the condition, some of whom have Crohn's or Colitis themselves. Celebrities include: Rylan Clark Neil (co-host of the tv series Big Brother) and Sam Faiers who was at the walk i attended in June 2017, Anastasia (the singer), Lewis Moody, Sir Steve Redgrave (five-time olympic gold medal champion) and Jeff Hordley (who plays Cain Dingle in the ITV british soap opera Emmerdale). Here is a video of Jeff sharing his experiences and when he was first diagnosed. Jeff became an ambassador for IBD in 2009. He is extremely passionate about supporting and raising awareness for C&C UK.

    <p>At present there is no diagnosis to pin-point the actual cause of Crohn's or Colitis and there is also no cure. This is why supporting C&CUk is extremely important, because with funding C&CUk can do more research and conduct trails amoungst many other things. For more than 30 years Crohn's and Colitis have been leading the drive to increase knowledge and the best treatments of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis patients. C&C Uk have recently published a book called "The Power Of Research - 10 Years of Crohn's and Colitis Uk research" and £5.2 million has been awarded to over 80 research projects since 2008. The research conducted by medical professionals leads to vital discoveries about the different forms of IBD - and continuies to do so. The studies C&CUK fund help medical professionals develop better treatments and support for IBD patients. If you know somebody who has IBD, perhaps a family member of friend or you would want to give support, head on over to the <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/">Crohn's and Colitis UK</a> official website and click the green button to sign up to "become a member"!
