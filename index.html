  <p>Hi all, i am Simon. In May 2005 i was diagnosed with a life changing crohnic illness called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease">"Crohn's Disease"</a> which is a type of (IBD) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</a>. I have spent the past 13 years in and out of the (RLH) Royal London Hospital undergoing multiple re-attempts at corrective surgery. Before i was diagnosed, i was working towards a carpentry degree with a provider called John Laing. The Royal London Hospital has been re-built over the past 10 years. I have been fortunate enough to experience "the best of both worlds" so to speak. The old and the newly build Royal London Hospital equipt with it's leading trauma and emergency care centres and home to London's Air Ambulance service.</p>

  <p>During this period, i had to think really hard about what i would like to do considering the Dr's and Surgeons told me i would still have a good quality of life. I seached around to get back into carpentry, i had no joy, i also considered working in the hospital because at the time i knew everything in regards to hospital procedure. While i was in hospital, i met 3 other guys who were in their early - mid 20's at the time and in the same situation as me. One has gone awol and the other two unfortunately will never get better (according to the surgeons), so i consider myself extremely fortunate and grateful for a second shot at life. Things may not have turned out a so well for me, if i ignored my instincts at the time.<p/>

  <p>One day during lunchtime in hospital, i bumped into a woman in the corridor, she recognised that the intravenous mediction i was administering at time was similar to the medication her son was currently on, so she kind of knew we had similar issues. She said hello and started talking to me asking questions about my illness, i was only to happy to talk to her (as you probably know hospitals can be a lonely place). She asked if i would like to come and meet her son (Ryan) as he has the same condition as me and he wasn't doing very well with coping as he recently had his first operation. I did not know at the time that this would be the start of my programming journey! I was happy to go and meet him, as at the time i was in hospital alone by that time. So after lunch, i went around to his room and knocked the door.They invited me in, and i looked to my right and on the bed i saw a fraile  man in his early - mid twenties curled up on the bed, he looked so frightend and anxious. His mum introduced me, he quickly perked up when he realised he had a visitor. I found out later that day that Ryan had 2 current jobs, he studied for a few years and got his BsHons at a university in Lancashire and was already working as a software developer, he was also a police officer. We started hanging out and he showed me some of the app he made himself (kids games) that were now in the playStore selling at Â£0.99. I was fascinated , and he said that i could do the same thing , nowadays you no longer have to go to university and do a 4 year course to become a software dev he said you can do it all online now as long as you have the time and the determination.<p/><br/>

  <p>He did much better over the following weeks / months and was realeased from hospital. He had his final surgery and went back to work doing what he loves, with only a small scar down the middle of his belly as a reminder of his experience. So when i finally got discharged, i was a home one day on my pc and i came across this a course provider called CodeCademy and the rest as they say is history. I paid to enroll and within a year I earnt a credential "Build Websites From Scratch" from the codecademy Pro Intensive curriculum. The tutors were collectively impressed with my final "Capstone" project. Here are <a href="https://www.credential.net/go9gf2ie">my credentials</a>.</p>
